"pm paul . kaufman enron . com , susan . j . mara enron . com , leslie . lawn er enron . com , m day m day gms sr . com subject re ab xx bad bill alert jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"actually , there was one new development late yesterday . frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having andy fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation capacity information in his capacity as cfo of enron corp . the same concern would , of course apply to andy fastow's successor . that was why frazier had suggested cindy olsen . i spoke with mary kay and told her about this concern . she understands , but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation capacity information . i'll work with frazier to see if we can identify someone . so , let's hold off for now in contacting jeff mcmahon . i'll keep you updated . thanks .",i have no objection . drew do you want to contact mcmahon's office or should i . either way is fine . greg

"do you know where your assets are ? i vita does thursday , november , i vita arrives on the e business scene with a unique value proposition . it provides enterprises with a mechanism to track , value , and allocate assets with the goal of optimizing asset utilization , increasing cash flow , and improving financial controls . the i vita web hosted system provides a repository for information on the status of physical assets , the market value of the assets , and the financial implications , including tax treatment , of the different uses of the assets . in essence , it provides business intelligence for asset management . i vita is currently working with several enterprise customers as well as the pantel los and network oil exchanges , but it will be sometime next year before we see the results of the first pilots . the i vita approach to asset management is different from the typical enterprise asset management eam approach . most eam implementations deal with the procurement and maintenance of plant assets . as long as the asset is performing the task it was procured for , the eam application will track it and manage its maintenance . however , if the asset becomes idle , it quickly disappears off the eam screen . yet , from a financial perspective the asset is still on the books . maybe it can be deployed in another plant or facility . maybe it can be sold as surplus through an online exchange . maybe it should be scrapped for tax purposes . in most organizations , these questions go unanswered for long periods of time because the asset is no longer visible . i vita provides that visibility over the internet so that financial departments can make timely decisions for asset deployment or disposal . some , if not all , of the functionality i vita provides can be created as part of an eam implementation using applications from vendors such as indus international and mincom . however , a complete eam implementation , with financial integration , will consume considerable time and company resources . it may also take years to implement . and at the end of the project enterprise wide asset visibility may not be available because the data is locked up in plant specific implementations . by focusing on a specific problem asset visibility from a financial perspective and providing the visibility as a web hosted service , i vita has reduced implementation time to weeks and reduced the time it takes to get a return on investment roi . the approach will appeal to users tired of long implementation cycles with difficult to measure rois . leif eriksen","david kobie row skis r . account manager forrester research , inc . congress ave . , suite austin , tx d kobie row ski forrester . com phone fax"

"i don't agree edison's premise that direct access customers contributed just as much to sce's procurement costs under collection as bundled service customers . we need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric . here's my reasoning . da customers are completely different from bundled customers . sce had to bu y power to serve the bundled load . sce did not buy power for da customers . sce's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for the under collection . i can make the argument that the under collection is so lely related to bundled service . there are two big reasons that back me up ab and top down rates . i w ill explain . the utilities got what they wanted out of ab payments of plus billion in so called stranded costs and a real delay in any co m petitive retail market until their costs were paid off . one of the trade o ffs , however , was that the utilities were at risk for high prices in the wh ole sale market . everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or bad hydro years , the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill ions by the deadline . that's the risk they agreed to . now , they ar e claiming that they were entitled to that money and more . this is in dire ct conflict with the statute . i can make the argument that the statute requ ires sce to assume this risk and therefore any under collection is theirs al one now the cpuc can bail them out but that doesn't make esps subject to any presumed under collection . now to the rates . at the beginning of da , the utilities did not want to do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the retail busness from t d . so , they did a top down calculation . this meant that there had to be a credit put on the bills of da customers to accoun t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to da . s o , the px credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwilling ne ss to unbundle specific components of the rates . next , although bundled cu s tomers rates were capped , the decisions from the cpuc made it clear that t here was no similar cap for da customers their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by their esps . however , when the utilities filed thei r tariffs with the cpuc , they added a cap for the px credit that was nei the r proposed nor authorized by the commission . enron attacked it , but got no where , until wpt f and enron brought it up in the rap proceeding . our a r gument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of da cust omers and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the util it ies avoided by not serving da customers . we argued that anything less is f und a mentally unfair and anti come pti tive . the utilities must have thought w e had a good case , because they agreed to settle . the settlement was accept ed by the commission in the proceeding . everyone understood that eliminat in g the cap on the px credit was primarily to allow the px credit to float ab ove the cap when wholesale prices were high . so , we have a legal right to r e ceive the full px credit negative ctc which is separate and distinct from any under collection associated with bundled customers . it seems as if we sh ould be able to prosecute this legal right . keeping in mind i am not an at torney in summary , we have leverage and should use it . sue",fyi .

"david , for clarification , i was present during mark stub ley's brief training session over the phone . i memorialized the key points in a summary email . let me know if you or anyone else would like a copy of it . on the issue of ogletree training , i had mentioned that it might be more cost efficient to have someone in florida conduct the training . mike had indicated a preference to use mark stub ley at ogletree . of course , since mark has done it for us in the past , i am ok with him doing it as well . i just was looking at the outside expenditures , as we all have been doing lately particularly outside counsel bills , and thought that there may be some cost savings . in some circumstances , outside counsel who have to travel cut their rates a bit for travel time don't know if stub ley does that , so the cost differential could be minimal , but i thought i'd raise it since there are qualified attorneys in florida who could assist in that arena . i'll give mark a call to finalize the issue of local counsel , which i do not believe to be significant . because mark has contacted them , they already have run a conflict check and are ready to go . all it would take to get them engaged would be a phone call . there should not be any cost incurred at this point , because they only are on standby , so i think it is good to line them up . i'll let you know if jim derrick has any issue with their recommendation . i also have received recommendations for top notch local labor counsel in florida if we choose to go that route . let me know if you have any questions . michelle",david . lund nep co . com or david lu nep co . com

"spain and california please , note that the regulator cne , advisory body has recently declared that the california situation cannot happen in spain , although it is likely that some isolated blackouts may happen in the east coast this summer . physical crisis in spain to me , it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load margins in the spanish power market have been recently decreasing , and that more generation capacity is needed ! in fact , ree red electric a de espana , the transmission company and tso is relatively worried about shortages of capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years percent . in spain , no major power plants have been built in the last years . the avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced including enron's arcos ccgt mw since outset of liberalisation could cope with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation , regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed . authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that bad , and so it is connection to the electricity grid . however , access to gas pipelines still remains as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these new gas fired power plants , but mostly , that some of the cc gts projects as enron's get financed find attached the memo about the enron's arcos power plant . pipelines are owned are managed by en a gas , which is percent owned by gas natural , who controls more than of gas supplies in spain . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . prompt and adequate d development of the gas system to make sure new gas fired plants are built . . for these new cc gts to get financed , it is necessary that firm and continuous access is ensured by en a gas . financial crisis in spain the regulator has also said that given the vertically integrated structure of the spanish power utilities , it is impossible that the california's financial crisis happen . this is only partially true because the ctcs buffer stranded costs payments have mitigated the financial stress of the utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs . in reality , what will prevent a financial crisis in spain will be the government , by increasing tariffs if things go nasty . however , from the enron perspective , the existence of ctcs is distorting the market , both for retailing activities and the development of power projects , since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts of the spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as possible . by , all customers will be eligible . . it is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated distribution and non regulated activities generation and supply , facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market , and reducing the market share of incumbents . italy and california similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in italy as those in spain are equally valid . in addition , please note . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants . . it is imperative that the italian tso facilitates the localisation of new power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the transmission system capacity and expansion plans . the tso must be there to help new developers actually , the italian tso is very aware of this and has publicly declared to wish to go in this direction . . the italian power pool was due for jan , but its start has being delayed , and it is uncertain when it will happen . for new entrants , to have the pool live and running is of special interest to a increase the understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the italian market and b to increase liquidity . also , make sure you mention that the pool should help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all participants , mostly on its inception phase . please , find attached a short summary of the arcos situation . the main issue here is that en a gas gas transco monopoly is trying to grant access to transportation and reg as fication infrastructures conditional to the construction of a number of new infrastructures , which are also subject to obtaining permits issued by the authorities . instead , the regulator cne has basically imposed en a gas an obligation to build and grant access to enron on a firm and continuous basis , that is , no conditional . the regulator's decision is binding but not normative .",could you please forward to me the briefing materials you prepared for steve's speech in madrid ? thanks .

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"spain and california please , note that the regulator cne , advisory body has recently declared that the california situation cannot happen in spain , although it is likely that some isolated blackouts may happen in the east coast this summer . physical crisis in spain to me , it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load margins in the spanish power market have been recently decreasing , and that more generation capacity is needed ! in fact , ree red electric a de espana , the transmission company and tso is relatively worried about shortages of capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years percent . in spain , no major power plants have been built in the last years . the avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced including enron's arcos ccgt mw since outset of liberalisation could cope with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation , regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed . authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that bad , and so it is connection to the electricity grid . however , access to gas pipelines still remains as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these new gas fired power plants , but mostly , that some of the cc gts projects as enron's get financed find attached the memo about the enron's arcos power plant . pipelines are owned are managed by en a gas , which is percent owned by gas natural , who controls more than of gas supplies in spain . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . prompt and adequate d development of the gas system to make sure new gas fired plants are built . . for these new cc gts to get financed , it is necessary that firm and continuous access is ensured by en a gas . financial crisis in spain the regulator has also said that given the vertically integrated structure of the spanish power utilities , it is impossible that the california's financial crisis happen . this is only partially true because the ctcs buffer stranded costs payments have mitigated the financial stress of the utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs . in reality , what will prevent a financial crisis in spain will be the government , by increasing tariffs if things go nasty . however , from the enron perspective , the existence of ctcs is distorting the market , both for retailing activities and the development of power projects , since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts of the spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as possible . by , all customers will be eligible . . it is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated distribution and non regulated activities generation and supply , facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market , and reducing the market share of incumbents . italy and california similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in italy as those in spain are equally valid . in addition , please note . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants . . it is imperative that the italian tso facilitates the localisation of new power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the transmission system capacity and expansion plans . the tso must be there to help new developers actually , the italian tso is very aware of this and has publicly declared to wish to go in this direction . . the italian power pool was due for jan , but its start has being delayed , and it is uncertain when it will happen . for new entrants , to have the pool live and running is of special interest to a increase the understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the italian market and b to increase liquidity . also , make sure you mention that the pool should help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all participants , mostly on its inception phase . please , find attached a short summary of the arcos situation . the main issue here is that en a gas gas transco monopoly is trying to grant access to transportation and reg as fication infrastructures conditional to the construction of a number of new infrastructures , which are also subject to obtaining permits issued by the authorities . instead , the regulator cne has basically imposed en a gas an obligation to build and grant access to enron on a firm and continuous basis , that is , no conditional . the regulator's decision is binding but not normative .",could you please forward to me the briefing materials you prepared for steve's speech in madrid ? thanks .

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"the circuit breaker amp the circuit breaker amp creates both a concern that the day ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist . the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in new york energy price will be depressed . the potential ways in which the dam prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions costs . additionally , while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid , there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid . finally , the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power . every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the dam then they should have received . in addition to these questions about whether the amp will improperly depress prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated . this was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the nyiso has failed to provide any description of how this process will work . there is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted . the uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the new york market . price capped load bidding the price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the dam market prices . this provides the possibility that day ahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused . virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer . if virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior . the only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator day ahead market bids . as addressed above , the application of the circuit breaker amp is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market . penalty and public disclosure proposal this proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the nyiso market mitigation measures . there have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness . the penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers . the penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power . finally , the adr process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the nyiso but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate . each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the new york market . the above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets . each of these makes the new york market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the new york market . interestingly , the penalty and public disclosure proposal was approved by the nyiso management committee between the icap monthly auction and the icap deficiency auction . the above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the nyiso energy market . most notably , there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority . fortunately , both of these ill considered proposals were ultimately withdrawn . however , the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the icap market . two final points need to be clarified regarding mr . fernand's argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem . first , he lists the change in icap market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the icap markets . when generators bid into last summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the nyiso markets . there also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer . compared to last summer , icap bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures . second , he also uses the results of this summer's strip monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the icap market . because the entire icap requirement is not cleared in a single auction , the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an icap providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction . this requires the icap providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal icap providers . the results of this years auctions merely indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the earlier auctions . mr . fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the icap issue . if any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired through the committee process . nonetheless , one of the proposals should be killed at the outset . because being an icap provider to new york includes an obligation to bid into the energy market , no icap owners should ever be automatically bid into the deficiency auction or any other auction . mr . fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved if a long icap owner exclude itself . the act of choosing not to bid into the icap auction is in itself an indication that the icap provider has chosen to exclude itself . mark younger vice presidents later consulting werking road east greenbush , ny ph fax",stephen fernand s

"fyi . here is the last draft of the responses to ferc's questions . it is still missing a section in response to question that mary is drafting . i believe that ron has minimized the concerns that i had from the prior draft . he is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the san diego litigation . in response to question no . , he is asking ferc to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market , find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory . anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem . there is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it , that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption . as a practical matter , however , our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti trust laws , for example , the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway . ron and mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get ferc to make a finding . if ferc does make the finding , it will undoubtedly be appealed . i do not know how to assess the likelihood that ferc will make the requested finding , and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis . if we are going to go this route , i would take out the conditional phrase on page in the word version that reads if they were not in violation of market rules established under the iso's and px's tariffs . talk to you tomorrow . thanks gary",. .

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"spain and california please , note that the regulator cne , advisory body has recently declared that the california situation cannot happen in spain , although it is likely that some isolated blackouts may happen in the east coast this summer . physical crisis in spain to me , it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load margins in the spanish power market have been recently decreasing , and that more generation capacity is needed ! in fact , ree red electric a de espana , the transmission company and tso is relatively worried about shortages of capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years percent . in spain , no major power plants have been built in the last years . the avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced including enron's arcos ccgt mw since outset of liberalisation could cope with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation , regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed . authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that bad , and so it is connection to the electricity grid . however , access to gas pipelines still remains as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these new gas fired power plants , but mostly , that some of the cc gts projects as enron's get financed find attached the memo about the enron's arcos power plant . pipelines are owned are managed by en a gas , which is percent owned by gas natural , who controls more than of gas supplies in spain . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . prompt and adequate d development of the gas system to make sure new gas fired plants are built . . for these new cc gts to get financed , it is necessary that firm and continuous access is ensured by en a gas . financial crisis in spain the regulator has also said that given the vertically integrated structure of the spanish power utilities , it is impossible that the california's financial crisis happen . this is only partially true because the ctcs buffer stranded costs payments have mitigated the financial stress of the utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs . in reality , what will prevent a financial crisis in spain will be the government , by increasing tariffs if things go nasty . however , from the enron perspective , the existence of ctcs is distorting the market , both for retailing activities and the development of power projects , since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts of the spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as possible . by , all customers will be eligible . . it is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated distribution and non regulated activities generation and supply , facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market , and reducing the market share of incumbents . italy and california similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in italy as those in spain are equally valid . in addition , please note . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants . . it is imperative that the italian tso facilitates the localisation of new power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the transmission system capacity and expansion plans . the tso must be there to help new developers actually , the italian tso is very aware of this and has publicly declared to wish to go in this direction . . the italian power pool was due for jan , but its start has being delayed , and it is uncertain when it will happen . for new entrants , to have the pool live and running is of special interest to a increase the understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the italian market and b to increase liquidity . also , make sure you mention that the pool should help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all participants , mostly on its inception phase . please , find attached a short summary of the arcos situation . the main issue here is that en a gas gas transco monopoly is trying to grant access to transportation and reg as fication infrastructures conditional to the construction of a number of new infrastructures , which are also subject to obtaining permits issued by the authorities . instead , the regulator cne has basically imposed en a gas an obligation to build and grant access to enron on a firm and continuous basis , that is , no conditional . the regulator's decision is binding but not normative .",could you please forward to me the briefing materials you prepared for steve's speech in madrid ? thanks .

"i would stress the importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implement a ion of wholesale markets . r to participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well . you included some elements of this topic under the title an installed capacity requirement is not necessary . it does fit under this title , but i think it is more than that . perhaps a separate item . a few possible additional points a demand response has been very limited so far , because customers have been under a regulatory shield b a few attempts to make load see correct prices have been very encouraging . there is still a long way to go , though . c there has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices e . g . dsb d wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways , such as i increased chances for the market to clear at all times ii mitigate price spikes and as a consequence the need for caps ; iii proxy for reserves e it will take some time to get demand response . in the meantime , some interim measures may be necessary , such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments your footnote to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level . f even for this interim period , we do not support caps . by not having caps , the rationale for capacity payment disappears . ferc will deal with market power , if any , on an ad hoc basis m , by not allowing market based rates , instead of caps . this is the approach miso has been taking and we agreed with it . what about including the text a well designed r to as an attachment ? the one recently prepared by janel . hydro i agree with your point that lmp may work in a hydro based system . the only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade . in that case , plants are not free to bid there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management . the marginal price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process , but it is the shadow price of an optimization program . this very same price could be the basis for the lmp . not a big deal . hydro plants do not like lmp because , in general , they are far away from consumer centers and lmp with technical losses penalizes them a lot . we should stick to our point that lmp should be used across all rtos . still on lmp on the northwest page , second paragraph . i agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out . for example , generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum or maximum requirements . however , i would not call this allowing bilateral contracts . i would call it accomodate must run requirements caused by operational in flexibilities . for example , if a run of river plant decides to be merchant , it still should have the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run still on lmp for hydro . i am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the northwest r to . steve walton to confirm . otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page . i think david suggested to use the ny example i am not familiar with capacity payment page last paragraph . finally , any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a spec itc generator as a physical product . i know what you meant , but it may lead to dubious interpretations . it may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures . if we were able to get property rights on reliability issues , the capacity fee discussion wou uld be a no brainer . i would eliminate the sentence . capacity payment page last paragraph our white paper on capacity footnote does not clearly say that the r to should the purchasing agent during the interim period . it may be the case provider of last resource , but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution . what we can certainly say is that in the interim period the r to should be responsible for system adequacy plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all control areas as opposed to having each one of them working independently sorry for the long e mail . i hope it helps . lm",sarah file comments on r to week revised . doc

"i think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed . the only concern i have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight . in fact we do no have several bills on demand side management , one by wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation , at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ab x , and ab own bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ab x . so i am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for along term solution . perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements . . . . and then lay out our case . sandi , do you agree with my concerns ? otherwise the elements of the letter are fine , and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language . i will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review , even though we may later want to consoli ate the entire package . please call if you have any more questions . thanks , mike day","mike , sandi wanted me to forward a draft letter from steve kean to the governor and legislature for your review and comment . scott"

"with regards to the historical data . i understand that it is less work for enron if kio dex gets this data from their customers . however , i think the rationale behind requesting it from eol is the belief that many of our tier ii and iii customers trade a significant percentage of their book on eol . furthermore , kio dex believes that these customers are likely to be less technologically sophisticated and may have difficulty transferring the data electronically themselves thereby necessitating cumbersome manual entry . finally , i don't understand how much work it would be for eol given that it would be a one time event for each customer to be done after hours . i don't agree that the only relevant gauge of customers is number of executed contracts . i would argue that it is possible maybe even probable if we don't facilitate the transfer of historical transaction data for a customer to become exposed to kio dex on eol , become a paying customer of kio dex , and decide not to have their trades forwarded on a real time basis from eol preferring to do this themselves . if this were to occur , there would be no need for the customer to sign a contract with enron and , as a result , we would not receive credit for that customer in our warrant calculations . neither of these points is particularly critical . furthermore , i do believe that kio dex will agree to the terms outlined in the revised co marketing document attached below , but i think there may be benefit to us to considering these points . let me know your thoughts . thanks . drew x",file co marketing . doc

"sunday , november , at approximately cst , eigrp routing protocol neighbor connections between the portland router and the houston router began to timeout . the frequency of this occurrence was mentioned in the previous email from phillip platter . the problem cleared up at cst . when debugging the problem , all test results pointed to a problem on the ein . however when the ebs noc was contacted , they informed us that there had been no known network issues or scheduled changes . because of what i experienced while debugging , i had an ebs network engineer come to my office this morning to walk thru the historical log data of physical devices within the houston to portland path . the problem was finally pinpointed to an ein ds link . a gsr router to which this link was attached was losing ospf neighbor connections with it's peer on the other side of the link due to a bouncing interface , thus causing the eigrp neighbor connectivity errors . realizing this is a critical link on which x trading is conducted , the following actions items will be addressed ? we will be implementing our own monitoring device currently only able to monitor up down response time on the edge of the ein in an attempt to more proactively monitor the path being utilized . ? i will verify with ebs that all appropriate devices are being monitored by the noc and that a notification process be implemented should include both problem and change notification . ? i will push the issue of gaining access to the ein edge router . this will allow us to more efficiently troubleshoot manage monitor ein link status and errors . knowing the error type and frequency will allow for quicker determination on severity and , therefore , implementation of secondary solutions . ar shak , because of the following concerns , it appears to me that the noc is not appropriately monitoring ein devices and , in return , negatively impacting enron business . i am copying you on this note because i need your assistance in identifying a contact for the noc in which to communicate these concerns and to work with in implementing processes to help alleviate future issues . concerns ? time required to fix this problem . hours i think it finally cleared up on its own ? the lack of notification or knowledge on the problem ? the erroneous information being communicated to the customer enron networks . keith",i am hoping this problem is isolated to sunday .

"following this week's discussions , we have recalculated the absolute mini mu m number of people required to keep your present systems in production . in recalculating this number , we have eliminated everything except that which is required for non elective maintenance . although many of the systems have been in operation for some time , we still frequently encounter problem s which interrupt production . such events require emergency attention and are what we refer to as non elective maintenance . therefore , in re calcul ating these support staff , we have excluded any effort for improvements or other changes that the users have previously identified for next year's wor k . also , we are suggesting excluding any further effort on the saber set tl ement , geo qual , market intelligence , dpc tax media services systems which we will simply wrap up as those are and put them in moth balls for possi ble future use . as the result of this process , we have come to a core mini mum number of people required to simply ensure that the remaining system s continue to function . the only way that we can logically reduce this cor e number any further would be to turn off other production systems . alth ough we recognize that the concept of turning off other production systems is unattractive , it would be far better to have this happen in a planned , o rd erly fashion than having them crash in an unrecoverable condition later . regards , in ja chun","file ebs systems diagram . vsd regards , in ja chun"

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"fyi . here is the last draft of the responses to ferc's questions . it is still missing a section in response to question that mary is drafting . i believe that ron has minimized the concerns that i had from the prior draft . he is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the san diego litigation . in response to question no . , he is asking ferc to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market , find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory . anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem . there is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it , that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption . as a practical matter , however , our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti trust laws , for example , the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway . ron and mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get ferc to make a finding . if ferc does make the finding , it will undoubtedly be appealed . i do not know how to assess the likelihood that ferc will make the requested finding , and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis . if we are going to go this route , i would take out the conditional phrase on page in the word version that reads if they were not in violation of market rules established under the iso's and px's tariffs . talk to you tomorrow . thanks gary",. .

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"i think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed . the only concern i have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight . in fact we do no have several bills on demand side management , one by wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation , at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ab x , and ab own bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ab x . so i am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for along term solution . perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements . . . . and then lay out our case . sandi , do you agree with my concerns ? otherwise the elements of the letter are fine , and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language . i will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review , even though we may later want to consoli ate the entire package . please call if you have any more questions . thanks , mike day","mike , sandi wanted me to forward a draft letter from steve kean to the governor and legislature for your review and comment . scott"

"the price to tri gen is a month average of ngw and if for z and z times a premium . because only one month at a time rolls off the books , there will always be an oa variance . the oa variance due to the month rolling average will eventually flatten out over time . this oa variance , however , doesn't address the fact that andy is getting z and z and having to deliver z . for november , there was some gas that was delivered at z , but the price was not adjusted for fuel and transport , so if you deliver gas at station , you do not get the same price as you would for station . hopefully this makes sense . diane x",hope this is what you were looking for . please let me know if you need anything else . pl

"spain and california please , note that the regulator cne , advisory body has recently declared that the california situation cannot happen in spain , although it is likely that some isolated blackouts may happen in the east coast this summer . physical crisis in spain to me , it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load margins in the spanish power market have been recently decreasing , and that more generation capacity is needed ! in fact , ree red electric a de espana , the transmission company and tso is relatively worried about shortages of capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years percent . in spain , no major power plants have been built in the last years . the avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced including enron's arcos ccgt mw since outset of liberalisation could cope with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation , regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed . authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that bad , and so it is connection to the electricity grid . however , access to gas pipelines still remains as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these new gas fired power plants , but mostly , that some of the cc gts projects as enron's get financed find attached the memo about the enron's arcos power plant . pipelines are owned are managed by en a gas , which is percent owned by gas natural , who controls more than of gas supplies in spain . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . prompt and adequate d development of the gas system to make sure new gas fired plants are built . . for these new cc gts to get financed , it is necessary that firm and continuous access is ensured by en a gas . financial crisis in spain the regulator has also said that given the vertically integrated structure of the spanish power utilities , it is impossible that the california's financial crisis happen . this is only partially true because the ctcs buffer stranded costs payments have mitigated the financial stress of the utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs . in reality , what will prevent a financial crisis in spain will be the government , by increasing tariffs if things go nasty . however , from the enron perspective , the existence of ctcs is distorting the market , both for retailing activities and the development of power projects , since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts of the spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as possible . by , all customers will be eligible . . it is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated distribution and non regulated activities generation and supply , facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market , and reducing the market share of incumbents . italy and california similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in italy as those in spain are equally valid . in addition , please note . messages they are not confrontational to anybody . applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants . . it is imperative that the italian tso facilitates the localisation of new power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the transmission system capacity and expansion plans . the tso must be there to help new developers actually , the italian tso is very aware of this and has publicly declared to wish to go in this direction . . the italian power pool was due for jan , but its start has being delayed , and it is uncertain when it will happen . for new entrants , to have the pool live and running is of special interest to a increase the understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the italian market and b to increase liquidity . also , make sure you mention that the pool should help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all participants , mostly on its inception phase . please , find attached a short summary of the arcos situation . the main issue here is that en a gas gas transco monopoly is trying to grant access to transportation and reg as fication infrastructures conditional to the construction of a number of new infrastructures , which are also subject to obtaining permits issued by the authorities . instead , the regulator cne has basically imposed en a gas an obligation to build and grant access to enron on a firm and continuous basis , that is , no conditional . the regulator's decision is binding but not normative .",could you please forward to me the briefing materials you prepared for steve's speech in madrid ? thanks .

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"thank y'all so much for your help on this . we are trying to improve the language relating to the termination payment section . in the bandwidth trading master . the old version had a very complicated and repetitive formula that tried to reflect replacement costs but in practice did not do so i will not go into why here . based on some is da materials sent to me by elizabeth sager , as well as the benefit of the trading forms in some of our other businesses , we have come up with the attached . i would be so grateful if you could give me some feedback on this . as soon as you can because we are a bit strapped in producing agreements . as i mentioned to mark on the phone today , i am also trying to work out how critical is the provision allowing for payment by the non defaulting party to the defaulting party . as we know , most of the time a non defaulting party would not elect to terminate if they thought they were going to have to make a payment , but given our strictly physical , not overly liquid market at the moment , this provision has the old time telecoms companies with their eyeballs swivelling around in their sockets of course the agreement as a whole is a bit of a shock to them , but this seems to be the provision they cannot get their brains around . although i am not necessarily suggesting we take this feature out of the form , i would just like your thoght s on whether we have any flexibility to delete it where necessary . finally , i note that our form does not have any provision to suspend delivery if the buyer is not paying . again , given the physical delivery character of this market , i would recommend we add such a feature . i will anxiously await your feedback . . . and again , many thanks .","james , here is the master agreement form . the font is all the same size style . cheers , pauline"

"i think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed . the only concern i have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight . in fact we do no have several bills on demand side management , one by wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation , at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ab x , and ab own bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ab x . so i am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for along term solution . perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements . . . . and then lay out our case . sandi , do you agree with my concerns ? otherwise the elements of the letter are fine , and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language . i will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review , even though we may later want to consoli ate the entire package . please call if you have any more questions . thanks , mike day","mike , sandi wanted me to forward a draft letter from steve kean to the governor and legislature for your review and comment . scott"

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan
