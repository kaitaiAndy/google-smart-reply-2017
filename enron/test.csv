"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the

"public hearing on revised energy law en wg novelle the german parliment voted for a open hearing in conjunction with deliberations over the revision to the energy law . we had been pushing hard for such a hearing so as to be able to get ef et and other like minded associations to voice our concerns about the lack of real market opening in the gas and power markets . the hearing is now scheduled for th th of sept and i will probably speak on behalf of ef et germany . possible application of article by eu commission to force greater more rapid market opening tensions between germany and the eu on lack of implementation of the gas directive and german instr ansi gence on regulated tpa and cross border issues continues to build . indeed , the atmosphere is quite tense now and it seems likely that the eu will no employ the nuclear option of article to force greater and more rapid market opening in member states . peter can add to this gas vv negotiations difficult german cartel office sends highly critical letter to associations the negotiations of amendments to the german gas network agreement continue to move at a snail's pace . key issues that we have argued for cost based tar riffs , development of standard transport and storage contracts , replacement of point to point tariff model with an exit entry system have yet to be addressed largely because the gas industry is wholly opposed to making these part of the negotiations . the negotiating associations to the network agreement so called vv gas have been criticized in a letter from the head of the german cartel office . he concludes that there efforts have not produced a basis for gas competition in germany and that if significant progress is not made in the next few months , the cartel office does not see how germany can continue to defend the model of negotiated access and may have to accept a regulated solution . negotiation begin for access to baltic cable after many months of correspondence and insistence by philip davies that baltic cable provide us with terms for tpa , the new managment of baltic cable has agreed to meet with us to negotiate access . negotiations will begin with e on now manager of baltic on the th . omv tag fin co some weeks ago we initiated a formal proceeding against the austrian pipeline company for effective denial of access to their long distance pipe running to italy . after several hours of hearings , the ministry accepted enron's complaint and rejected omv's petition to withdraw the complaint . the ministry provided clear indications to omv that they would prefer a negotiated settlement but were ready to proceed with a full scale investigation if necessary . the pressure was sufficient to bring omv to the table and we are now in the process of trying to reach closure of firm capacity through austria and into italy . should we fail to conclude agreement by july th , the case against omv will resume .",any updates for me to communicate tommorow on steve's call ? please e mail or call . thanks .

"interesting new perspective . by imposing environmental dispatch on plants operating extra hours over their air quality permits , the scope of the bill actually becomes broader than just rmr units . enron's new plants could well be some of the cleanest plants , and have an advantage , but this bill would also apply mainly to older plants that have air district limits on their ability to run , and environmental dispatch of those plants could change the market for power by eliminating ec nomo mic rank ordering of dispatch in the marketplace , and give the iso a greater hand in dispatching generation . i think we need to ask the traders about this asap . my guess is that they will not like it . mike day",f . y . i .

"the circuit breaker amp the circuit breaker amp creates both a concern that the day ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist . the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in new york energy price will be depressed . the potential ways in which the dam prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions costs . additionally , while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid , there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid . finally , the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power . every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the dam then they should have received . in addition to these questions about whether the amp will improperly depress prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated . this was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the nyiso has failed to provide any description of how this process will work . there is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted . the uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the new york market . price capped load bidding the price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the dam market prices . this provides the possibility that day ahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused . virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer . if virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior . the only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator day ahead market bids . as addressed above , the application of the circuit breaker amp is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market . penalty and public disclosure proposal this proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the nyiso market mitigation measures . there have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness . the penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers . the penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power . finally , the adr process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the nyiso but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate . each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the new york market . the above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets . each of these makes the new york market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the new york market . interestingly , the penalty and public disclosure proposal was approved by the nyiso management committee between the icap monthly auction and the icap deficiency auction . the above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the nyiso energy market . most notably , there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority . fortunately , both of these ill considered proposals were ultimately withdrawn . however , the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the icap market . two final points need to be clarified regarding mr . fernand's argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem . first , he lists the change in icap market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the icap markets . when generators bid into last summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the nyiso markets . there also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer . compared to last summer , icap bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures . second , he also uses the results of this summer's strip monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the icap market . because the entire icap requirement is not cleared in a single auction , the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an icap providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction . this requires the icap providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal icap providers . the results of this years auctions merely indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the earlier auctions . mr . fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the icap issue . if any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired through the committee process . nonetheless , one of the proposals should be killed at the outset . because being an icap provider to new york includes an obligation to bid into the energy market , no icap owners should ever be automatically bid into the deficiency auction or any other auction . mr . fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved if a long icap owner exclude itself . the act of choosing not to bid into the icap auction is in itself an indication that the icap provider has chosen to exclude itself . mark younger vice presidents later consulting werking road east greenbush , ny ph fax",stephen fernand s

"sunday , november , at approximately cst , eigrp routing protocol neighbor connections between the portland router and the houston router began to timeout . the frequency of this occurrence was mentioned in the previous email from phillip platter . the problem cleared up at cst . when debugging the problem , all test results pointed to a problem on the ein . however when the ebs noc was contacted , they informed us that there had been no known network issues or scheduled changes . because of what i experienced while debugging , i had an ebs network engineer come to my office this morning to walk thru the historical log data of physical devices within the houston to portland path . the problem was finally pinpointed to an ein ds link . a gsr router to which this link was attached was losing ospf neighbor connections with it's peer on the other side of the link due to a bouncing interface , thus causing the eigrp neighbor connectivity errors . realizing this is a critical link on which x trading is conducted , the following actions items will be addressed ? we will be implementing our own monitoring device currently only able to monitor up down response time on the edge of the ein in an attempt to more proactively monitor the path being utilized . ? i will verify with ebs that all appropriate devices are being monitored by the noc and that a notification process be implemented should include both problem and change notification . ? i will push the issue of gaining access to the ein edge router . this will allow us to more efficiently troubleshoot manage monitor ein link status and errors . knowing the error type and frequency will allow for quicker determination on severity and , therefore , implementation of secondary solutions . ar shak , because of the following concerns , it appears to me that the noc is not appropriately monitoring ein devices and , in return , negatively impacting enron business . i am copying you on this note because i need your assistance in identifying a contact for the noc in which to communicate these concerns and to work with in implementing processes to help alleviate future issues . concerns ? time required to fix this problem . hours i think it finally cleared up on its own ? the lack of notification or knowledge on the problem ? the erroneous information being communicated to the customer enron networks . keith",i am hoping this problem is isolated to sunday .

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"fyi . here is the last draft of the responses to ferc's questions . it is still missing a section in response to question that mary is drafting . i believe that ron has minimized the concerns that i had from the prior draft . he is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the san diego litigation . in response to question no . , he is asking ferc to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market , find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory . anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem . there is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it , that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption . as a practical matter , however , our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti trust laws , for example , the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway . ron and mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get ferc to make a finding . if ferc does make the finding , it will undoubtedly be appealed . i do not know how to assess the likelihood that ferc will make the requested finding , and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis . if we are going to go this route , i would take out the conditional phrase on page in the word version that reads if they were not in violation of market rules established under the iso's and px's tariffs . talk to you tomorrow . thanks gary",. .

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"i have it in my briefcase , i just forgot to get it out . another slow day s o far . i checked on the internet today about fannie mae and ginnie mae per lisa's co m ments the other day . i learned that ginnie mae is a government owned compa ny that buys and sells mortgages for hud and fha loans . they are basically the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans . fannie mae basic ally does the same thing but is a non government owned company used to be government owned in . both entities have had a history of financing t he rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country . so lis a's friend relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if there is any truth to their future involvement in our area . based on some of the stories i read they tend to focus on really bad areas . my guess is that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mecha nism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market . so to the extent there are hud or fha loans in our neighborhood they are probably involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it . i had n o idea what these two entities did , kind of interesting . tom",don't forget to run off your pay statement for . we also need . lyne

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday

"sunday , november , at approximately cst , eigrp routing protocol neighbor connections between the portland router and the houston router began to timeout . the frequency of this occurrence was mentioned in the previous email from phillip platter . the problem cleared up at cst . when debugging the problem , all test results pointed to a problem on the ein . however when the ebs noc was contacted , they informed us that there had been no known network issues or scheduled changes . because of what i experienced while debugging , i had an ebs network engineer come to my office this morning to walk thru the historical log data of physical devices within the houston to portland path . the problem was finally pinpointed to an ein ds link . a gsr router to which this link was attached was losing ospf neighbor connections with it's peer on the other side of the link due to a bouncing interface , thus causing the eigrp neighbor connectivity errors . realizing this is a critical link on which x trading is conducted , the following actions items will be addressed ? we will be implementing our own monitoring device currently only able to monitor up down response time on the edge of the ein in an attempt to more proactively monitor the path being utilized . ? i will verify with ebs that all appropriate devices are being monitored by the noc and that a notification process be implemented should include both problem and change notification . ? i will push the issue of gaining access to the ein edge router . this will allow us to more efficiently troubleshoot manage monitor ein link status and errors . knowing the error type and frequency will allow for quicker determination on severity and , therefore , implementation of secondary solutions . ar shak , because of the following concerns , it appears to me that the noc is not appropriately monitoring ein devices and , in return , negatively impacting enron business . i am copying you on this note because i need your assistance in identifying a contact for the noc in which to communicate these concerns and to work with in implementing processes to help alleviate future issues . concerns ? time required to fix this problem . hours i think it finally cleared up on its own ? the lack of notification or knowledge on the problem ? the erroneous information being communicated to the customer enron networks . keith",i am hoping this problem is isolated to sunday .

"the circuit breaker amp the circuit breaker amp creates both a concern that the day ahead market prices will be depressed from the levels that should exist . the implementation of the circuit breaker raises concerns that the market prices in new york energy price will be depressed . the potential ways in which the dam prices could be depressed include failure to incorporate changing unit operating parameters , fuel costs , or emissions costs . additionally , while opportunity costs are a part of an acceptable bid , there is no methodology to keep the circuit breaker from effectively removing the opportunity costs for a circuit broken bid . finally , the design of the circuit breaker may result in numerous individual bids by different market participants being circuit broken when they are not exercises of market power . every time a bid is improperly circuit broken it affects all sellers because all sellers end up being paid less in the dam then they should have received . in addition to these questions about whether the amp will improperly depress prices , there is still uncertainty to how a generator that has been improperly mitigated is supposed to be able to be compensated . this was part of the original circuit breaker design but as of this point the nyiso has failed to provide any description of how this process will work . there is also uncertainty about the reference prices and the process that generators will follow in getting changes or exceptions to the reference prices accepted . the uncertainty raises the cost of being obligated to the new york market . price capped load bidding the price capped load bidding mechanism that is being implemented this summer provides a sophisticated tool to a small subset of market participants to determine whether they want to purchase at the dam market prices . this provides the possibility that day ahead market prices will systematically be depressed relative to the real time market if this mechanism is abused . virtual load bidding has been blocked for the summer . if virtual load bidding were implemented it would provide a potential check on this market manipulating behavior . the only check allowed in our market design is the inclusion of opportunity costs in the generator day ahead market bids . as addressed above , the application of the circuit breaker amp is likely to impede the generators including opportunity costs in their bids thereby eliminating the only check on using the price capped load bids to manipulate the market . penalty and public disclosure proposal this proposal will penalize market participants that are mitigated for exceeding the nyiso market mitigation measures . there have been issues raised related to this proposal regarding due process and fundamental fairness . the penalties only apply to generators and other suppliers . the penalty is not based upon a determination that the market participant has exercised market power . finally , the adr process can determine whether mitigation was properly applied by the nyiso but cannot determine whether the penalty that was applied was appropriate . each of the above measures has resulted in a potential reduction in energy market revenues and added significant uncertainty to the new york market . the above price control measures are not in place in the surrounding markets . each of these makes the new york market less desirable than its neighbors and raises the price of being obligated to the new york market . interestingly , the penalty and public disclosure proposal was approved by the nyiso management committee between the icap monthly auction and the icap deficiency auction . the above are not the only price control proposals that have been made for the nyiso energy market . most notably , there have been proposals for price caps in the energy market and retroactive price authority . fortunately , both of these ill considered proposals were ultimately withdrawn . however , the mere fact that they were proposed inflicts uncertainty on the energy market and therefore increases the expected prices in the icap market . two final points need to be clarified regarding mr . fernand's argument that the results of the auction indicate a problem . first , he lists the change in icap market clearing prices between last year and this year as indicating there is a problem in the icap markets . when generators bid into last summer's auction they had not yet experienced summer operation under the nyiso markets . there also had not been the broad range of price control measures proposed and adopted for this summer . compared to last summer , icap bids for this summer would have incorporated better understanding of the expected profits in the energy market as well the expected impacts of the price control measures . second , he also uses the results of this summer's strip monthly auction and the deficiency auction as an indication of there being problems in the icap market . because the entire icap requirement is not cleared in a single auction , the prices that are bid into the earlier auctions are essentially an icap providers estimate of its opportunity cost of selling in the earlier auction rather than selling in a later auction . this requires the icap providers to guess the likely bids of the marginal icap providers . the results of this years auctions merely indicate that those who sold in the early auctions apparently did not do a very good job of guessing the lost revenue associated with selling in the earlier auctions . mr . fernand's provides a set of proposed measures for addressing the icap issue . if any of them are worthy of be considered then they should be aired through the committee process . nonetheless , one of the proposals should be killed at the outset . because being an icap provider to new york includes an obligation to bid into the energy market , no icap owners should ever be automatically bid into the deficiency auction or any other auction . mr . fernand's suggests that that the automatic bidding requirement be relieved if a long icap owner exclude itself . the act of choosing not to bid into the icap auction is in itself an indication that the icap provider has chosen to exclude itself . mark younger vice presidents later consulting werking road east greenbush , ny ph fax",stephen fernand s

"fyi . here is the last draft of the responses to ferc's questions . it is still missing a section in response to question that mary is drafting . i believe that ron has minimized the concerns that i had from the prior draft . he is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the san diego litigation . in response to question no . , he is asking ferc to specifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summers market , find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determine that sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory . anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbate the problem . there is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it , that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there has been preemption . as a practical matter , however , our preliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti trust laws , for example , the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway . ron and mary clearly believe this is the one chance we have to get ferc to make a finding . if ferc does make the finding , it will undoubtedly be appealed . i do not know how to assess the likelihood that ferc will make the requested finding , and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefit analysis . if we are going to go this route , i would take out the conditional phrase on page in the word version that reads if they were not in violation of market rules established under the iso's and px's tariffs . talk to you tomorrow . thanks gary",. .

"jeff ; in response to your questions , i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past , i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months . however , now that it is moving they have got the message . williams kern river is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill . bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place . in addition to williams , i understand that questar , wspa , and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill . my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition , but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far . i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon . as for the bill itself , the problem is two fold . first , the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities . they take input from customers , but loretta is a command and control type all the way , and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold plated state regulated system . while the bill does not and cannot legally bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state , it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates . the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a year basis with exit fees . if they don't take this , they can only get interruptible service from the utilities . many if not all large customers , especially generators can not afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system . this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused . my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to re institute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate . the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate . my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office . this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates , and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california , although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time . this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs . please call if you have further questions . mike day",ed sen . pdf

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"i think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed . the only concern i have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight . in fact we do no have several bills on demand side management , one by wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation , at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ab x , and ab own bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ab x . so i am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for along term solution . perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements . . . . and then lay out our case . sandi , do you agree with my concerns ? otherwise the elements of the letter are fine , and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language . i will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review , even though we may later want to consoli ate the entire package . please call if you have any more questions . thanks , mike day","mike , sandi wanted me to forward a draft letter from steve kean to the governor and legislature for your review and comment . scott"

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan

"i would stress the importance of demand response as a key success factor for the implement a ion of wholesale markets . r to participants discussed this topic and shared this view as well . you included some elements of this topic under the title an installed capacity requirement is not necessary . it does fit under this title , but i think it is more than that . perhaps a separate item . a few possible additional points a demand response has been very limited so far , because customers have been under a regulatory shield b a few attempts to make load see correct prices have been very encouraging . there is still a long way to go , though . c there has to be serious regulatory efforts and flexible market rules to expose demand to wholesale prices e . g . dsb d wholesale market will benefit in multiple ways , such as i increased chances for the market to clear at all times ii mitigate price spikes and as a consequence the need for caps ; iii proxy for reserves e it will take some time to get demand response . in the meantime , some interim measures may be necessary , such as the one we proposed in lieu of capacity payments your footnote to achieve a certain reserve adequacy level . f even for this interim period , we do not support caps . by not having caps , the rationale for capacity payment disappears . ferc will deal with market power , if any , on an ad hoc basis m , by not allowing market based rates , instead of caps . this is the approach miso has been taking and we agreed with it . what about including the text a well designed r to as an attachment ? the one recently prepared by janel . hydro i agree with your point that lmp may work in a hydro based system . the only difficulty is when you have multiple ownership in the same cascade . in that case , plants are not free to bid there has to be a central coordination function on the river flow and reservoir management . the marginal price for the hydro does not come from a bidding process , but it is the shadow price of an optimization program . this very same price could be the basis for the lmp . not a big deal . hydro plants do not like lmp because , in general , they are far away from consumer centers and lmp with technical losses penalizes them a lot . we should stick to our point that lmp should be used across all rtos . still on lmp on the northwest page , second paragraph . i agree that some idiosyncrasies of the hydro system have to be worked out . for example , generation to accomodate the flow of the river minimum or maximum requirements . however , i would not call this allowing bilateral contracts . i would call it accomodate must run requirements caused by operational in flexibilities . for example , if a run of river plant decides to be merchant , it still should have the right to declare itself inflexible and therefore run still on lmp for hydro . i am assuming that the problem of multiple ownership in the cascade does not exist in the northwest r to . steve walton to confirm . otherwise the solution is not so simple as the one described in the second paragraph on page . i think david suggested to use the ny example i am not familiar with capacity payment page last paragraph . finally , any such program should not tie a capacity payment to a spec itc generator as a physical product . i know what you meant , but it may lead to dubious interpretations . it may convey the idea that players are not allowed to contract to avoid spike price exposures . if we were able to get property rights on reliability issues , the capacity fee discussion wou uld be a no brainer . i would eliminate the sentence . capacity payment page last paragraph our white paper on capacity footnote does not clearly say that the r to should the purchasing agent during the interim period . it may be the case provider of last resource , but we did not go that far in detailing the interim solution . what we can certainly say is that in the interim period the r to should be responsible for system adequacy plan reserves and make sure they are implemented across all control areas as opposed to having each one of them working independently sorry for the long e mail . i hope it helps . lm",sarah file comments on r to week revised . doc

"i think the letter is well organized to get our message across that a comprehensive solution is needed . the only concern i have is the reference at the end of the first paragraph to the crisis grows daily with no clear resolution offering long term relief in sight . in fact we do no have several bills on demand side management , one by wright on accelerating repowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary conservation , at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery ab x , and ab own bill to restore direct access rights compromised by ab x . so i am concerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the notion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for along term solution . perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal elements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to be clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the following elements . . . . and then lay out our case . sandi , do you agree with my concerns ? otherwise the elements of the letter are fine , and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative language . i will break down the proposals into groups of issues for ease of review , even though we may later want to consoli ate the entire package . please call if you have any more questions . thanks , mike day","mike , sandi wanted me to forward a draft letter from steve kean to the governor and legislature for your review and comment . scott"

"dj edison to call for end to calif elec de reg wed sources copyright c dow jones company , inc . los angeles dow jones edison international eix , saying the current state of california's power markets threatens the company with bankruptcy , will call wednesday for an end to california's four year experiment with deregulation , sources familiar with the issue told dow jones newswires . john bryson , chief executive of edison international , is expected to announce that the company's regulated utility unit , southern california edison , won't be able to recover more than billion in losses related to power purchases and continue serving its retail customers unless the state's deregulated market structure is scrapped . in a move tantamount to a call for re regulation , edison will propose to break ground on new power plants within days and re enter the power generation business southern california edison was required to exit under the state's landmark deregulation law , the sources said . edison plans to follow the announcement by filing a request with state regulators to increase retail electricity rates by as much as , the sources said , even though regulators rejected edison's request for a rate increase of last week . the utility has lined up the support of some state lawmakers for the broader proposal , which would require action by the state legislature , the sources said . southern california edison , with . million customers , is one of the country's largest electric utilities . edison was the first of the state's utilities to sign on to the deregulation effort and , as it says on its web site , played a central role in the restructuring of the electric industry in california . among the concessions won by utilities in is the rate freeze , which they demanded to help them recover costs related to deregulation but which is now producing huge losses . edison's current losses stem from an imbalance between the soaring prices it must pay to purchase power on the wholesale markets and the fixed rate at which it can sell power to its customers . about half of those losses are offset the utility'sown power sales revenues , which are accounted for separately and used to pay down deregulation related debt . rising power costs have produced a surplus in that account . edison wouldn't reveal the current size of the surplus , but said previously that the california power exchange paid the utility . billion over its generating costs for power through the end of september , at a time when its power purchase losses were . billion . power purchase losses mounting the net losses continue to mount . california's wholesale power prices hovered at record levels all summer and spiked even higher in the past two weeks , as colder weather arrived in the northwest at a time when much of california's power supply was down for maintenance . the price of power for delivery wednesday in california hit an average of , a megawatt hour tuesday , up from a megawatt hour a week ago , the result of high demand and a decision by california's wholesale market operator to lift its cap on prices . the rate southern california edison can charge its retail customers , however , is fixed at mwh . last week , merrill lynch co . mer downgraded its ratings for edison international and pg e corp . pcg , the parent of california's other major utility , pacific gas electric , to neutral , saying the utilities may be forced to file for bankruptcy if the state doesn't allow them to raise their retail rates . a morgan stanley dean witter mdw analyst drew the same conclusion monday , also cutting his rating to neutral . edison to this point has kept its power purchase losses off its earnings statement , in hopes that a political or regulatory solution will allow them to be collected later . the california public utilities commission put the hope of such a solution further out of reach last week , however , when it ruled against rate increases sought by edison and pg e . credit rating agency fitch inc . on monday lowered its ratings for edison international and southern california edison's senior unsecured debt to the a minus level , citing increased liquidity pressure and uncertainty about the utilities'ability to recover the costs of their power purchases . the agency downgraded edison international , the parent , because half its consolidated cash flow is provided by southern california edison . edison which sources said plans to remain in the retail electricity business said late last week that it has secured a billion line of credit and expects to have enough cash on hand to continue to pay for wholesale electricity for the next several months . california paid more than billion for power last week , sources said . some of that , however , was paid to southern california edison , which still generates about , megawatts of power in the state . shares in edison international have fallen over the past three weeks . they closed wednesday at . , down . . by jason leopold , dow jones newswires ; ; mail to jason . leopold dowjones . com mark golden contributed to this article . katie kaplan
